# Developer Onboarding Instructions

Welcome to the Postiz repository! This guide will help you get started as a new developer and highlight the main functionalities and important information.

---

## Overview

Postiz is an open-source, AI-powered social media scheduling tool. It supports platforms like X (Twitter), Bluesky, Mastodon, Discord, and more. The project is organized as a monorepo using NX, with separate apps for backend, frontend, workers, and more.

---

## Main Functionalities

- **Schedule social media posts** (with AI features)
- **Analytics** for measuring post performance
- **Team collaboration**: invite, comment, and schedule together
- **Marketplace**: exchange or buy posts
- **API**: public API for integrations

---

## Tech Stack

- **NX** (Monorepo management)
- **Next.js** (Frontend, React)
- **NestJS** (Backend, API)
- **Prisma** (ORM, PostgreSQL)
- **Redis** (BullMQ for queues)
- **Docker** (for local development and deployment)
- **pnpm** (package manager)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app.git
   cd postiz-app
   ```
2. **Start services**
   ```sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
4. **Configure environment**
   - Copy `.env` from the shared drive or `.env.example` and fill in required values.
5. **Prepare the database**
   ```sh
   pnpm run prisma-db-push
   ```
6. **Start development servers**
   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Monorepo Structure

This repository uses [NX](https://nx.dev/) to manage multiple apps and packages. Key folders:

- `apps/` â€” Main applications:
  - `backend/` â€” NestJS API server
  - `frontend/` â€” Next.js web frontend
  - `workers/` â€” Background jobs/queues
  - `cron/` â€” Scheduled tasks
  - `commands/` â€” CLI commands
- `libraries/` â€” Shared code (helpers, nestjs-libraries, react-shared-libraries)
- `sdk/` â€” Node.js SDK for external integrations
- `extension/` â€” Browser extension code

## Running and Testing Services

- **Run all services (dev):**
  ```sh
  pnpm run dev
  ```
- **Run a specific app:**
  ```sh
  nx serve <app>
  # Example: nx serve backend
  ```
- **Run tests:**
  ```sh
  pnpm test
  # or for a specific app:
  nx test <app>
  ```
- **Lint:**
  ```sh
  pnpm lint
  ```
- **Build:**
  ```sh
  pnpm build
  # or for a specific app:
  nx build <app>
  ```

## Debugging & Logs

- **Backend logs:** Output in terminal when running backend or `pnpm run dev`.
- **Frontend logs:** Output in terminal and browser console.
- **Workers/cron:** Output in their respective terminals.
- **.env settings:** Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for more verbose logs.

## Coding Standards & PR Process

- Follow the style in `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, and use `pnpm format` before PRs.
- Write clear commit messages.
- All code should be tested; add/modify tests as needed.
- Open a PR to `main` and request review.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more details.

## Secrets, API Keys, and Accounts

- **.env file:** Required for local development. Ask a team member for the latest version or use `.env.example` as a template.
- **API keys:** Some features require API keys (e.g., social media, email, AI). See `.env.example` for variable names and ask your lead for credentials.
- **Cloudflare, Redis, Postgres:** Use local Docker containers or team-provided cloud resources.
- **OAuth:** For social login, register your app with the provider and use your own keys for local testing.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ports in use:** Make sure 3000, 4200, 5000, 5432, 6379 are free or update your `.env` and Docker configs.
- **Database errors:** Check Postgres container is running and credentials match `.env`.
- **Redis errors:** Check Redis container is running.
- **Build errors:** Run `pnpm install` and try again. Check Node.js version (should be 18+).
- **Other issues:** See [support page](https://docs.postiz.com/support) or ask in Discord.
