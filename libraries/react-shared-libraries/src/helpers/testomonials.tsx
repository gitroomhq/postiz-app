        The UI is friendly and the AI content assistant is surprisingly
        effective for professional tones. I especially like how it adjusts to

        I just found out about Postiz, a tool for scheduling social media.{' '}
        {'\n'}
        Exactly what I wish there was a few years back, I even thought of
        building one myself at one point, but didn't have the time to. {'\n'}
        What I like about it so far: {'\n\n'}
        It connects to LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Facebook (and others) from one
        dashboard. {'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        Because it's open-source, you can see how it works and even tweak it if
        you need to. {'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        I've used a few scheduling tools before and most of them are either
        expensive or try to be "all-in-one marketing platforms." {'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        Postiz seems to focus on just doing one thing well. {'\n'}

        As a privacy-first company we appreciate being able to self-host Postiz!
        It brings all the core functionality of a social media scheduler plus a
        lot of AI to make things faster. It's also very easy to deploy and use,
        great work!

        Manage all your social media accounts from a single place: Postiz, a
        really cool tool I recently discovered :D! {'\n'}
        It comes with a bunch of cool tools for posting at specific times,
        posting across multiple platforms simultaneously, etc. And all of this
        can potentially be self-hosted for free; you just need a small server to
        configure everything ;D! It works really well :D!
